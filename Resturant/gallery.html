       <h1>BBQ Chicken Pizza</h1>
       <h3>Small:1500LKR<br>Medium:2000LKR<br>Large:3000LKR</h3><br>
       <p>This homemade BBQ chicken pizza features tangy BBQ sauce, pre-cooked chicken, and red onion. Mixing mozzarella with
    smoked gouda cheese makes for the most delicious flavor, and cilantro adds a touch of freshness. My pizza dough recipe
    makes enough for two 12-inch pizzas, so you can freeze half for later if you only want one pizza now. Ditch the
    restaurant because you can really taste the difference here!</p><br><br>

    <h1>Beef Pizza</h1>
    <h3>Small:1700LKR<br>Medium:2200LKR<br>Large:3200LKR</h3><br>
    <p>This is my kind of favorite pizza. I have not try this one but this is almost the same as the one I did without any
    recipe. This is from the issue of November 2005, Coup de Pouce. ETA : I made it on July 24, 2011. I used 1 lb of lean
    ground beef. And also a store-bought dough already made. I made this pizza sauce : recipe#460241 I added chopped red
    bell pepper. DH said 10 stars and he didn't know it was my recipe.</p>
